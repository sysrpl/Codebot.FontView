## What is Font View

Font View is a small cross platform desktop utility designed to aid users in selecting a font face. Often operating systems and their associated applications make it a bit tedious to select an appropriate font by mandating multiple mouse actions to preview the outline of a fonts at various sizes. Often they force the user to select a font before a preview is even presented to the user. The Font View utiltiy fixes this problem by handling font previews a bit differently. First, every font name is rendered in its own outline. Second, any time a font is selected you are given a preview of its outline in several sizes using every alpha character in its store.

See the video below to gain an understanding of how Font View is different.
